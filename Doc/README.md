Document Directory
---

This directory contains some general documentation


## Graphiz input files

Files that end in **.dot** are inputs to the graph drawing program [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org "Graphviz")

The Makefile will build all images using the dot program and output .png files. These output files are checked in to the repository if they are used in the wiki.


## Doxygen

There is a Doxyfile for doxygen document generation. Output will be placed in the directory **doxydocs**. This output directory is not committed to the repository.
