## otl files are text notes in outline form.

These are notes captured during discussions and investigation of requirements.

## QFD-lite - Experimental Requirement Capture and Tracking Spreadsheet

QFD '*Quality Function Deployment*' is a tool used for many years in supply chain management.
In this application many of the extensive options of QFD have been removed with the goals of:

* Tracking ***What*** needs to be done against. ***How*** to do it.
* Tracking the client priority on deliverables. ("***What***")  
* Tracking the client preference on methods. ("***How***")
* Creating a ***one-page*** requirements view of product.
* ***Focusing*** multi-party discussions during requirements capture and review. 
* ***Tracking*** completion state of deliverables.

### Experimental motivation

* Can this tool be usefully applied in a Software Engineering context?
* If this tool is not useful, why is it not useful?
* If this tool is useful, is the methodology more generally applicable or did the tool 'self-tune' to this project?
* In a firmware context, can manufacturing concerns be captured earlier in the product development process?
	* For example: provisioning, yield and field support

## Caveat

* While this may be a ***useful*** process, the risk lies in ***the process becoming the product***.
	* Experimental goal: Observe if ***QFD-lite*** is resistant to *reductio ad praxis*.
